Gauntlet 🥊

A combinatorial multi-agent stress test for high-stakes research proposals.

Gauntlet is a "virtual brainstorming engine" designed to subject research proposals (specifically one's that are a bit cross-cutting across areas) to intense scrutiny from simulated domain experts. It uses the Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 API to create a divergence-convergence feedback loop.

Instead of a single review, Gauntlet explodes the solution space:

    Divergence: Three distinct expert personas each critique the proposal three times at different temperatures (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), naturally producing conservative, balanced, and divergent takes (Total: 9 distinct critiques).

    Convergence (The Flywheel): A "Synthesizer" agent takes every combination of one critique per expert (3³ = 27) and generates a unique strategic synthesis report for each, helping you find the "Golden Thread" narrative that satisfies all constraints.

🧠 The Expert Panel (Simulated)

    Dr. Silas Vane: Expert in Chaos Control & Swarm Dynamics.

        Role: Focuses on emergent behavior, robustness, and mathematical proofs of stability in unpredictable environments.

    Prof. Amara Kito: Expert in Bio-Photonic Interfaces.

        Role: Focuses on the physical layer, energy constraints, biocompatibility, and the "wetware" interface constraints.

    Dr. Julian Rex: Expert in Exascale Cognitive Systems.

        Role: Focuses on massive scalability, foundation model architectures, and distributed system latency.

🚀 The Logic Flow

    Ingestion: The engine reads the proposal_call.pdf and my_proposal.pdf.

    The Gauntlet (Phase 1 — Divergence): Each expert reviews the proposal three times, once at each temperature (0.3, 0.7, 1.0). Low temperature yields precise, conservative critiques; high temperature yields creative, divergent pivots. This produces 9 distinct critique vectors with no manual prompt engineering.

    The Flywheel (Phase 2 — Convergence): The system computes the Cartesian product — one run per expert — giving 3³ = 27 unique input combinations. The Synthesizer agent produces a cohesive Action Plan for each. Every output folder is self-contained: SYNTHESIS.md plus copies of the three source reviews that fed it.

    Idempotent Resume: If you hit a rate limit mid-run, just re-run main.py. It skips any output that already exists and picks up exactly where it left off.

🛠 Usage

    Install dependencies:
    Bash

    pip install anthropic pypdf python-dotenv

    Add your API key to .env:
    Plaintext

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

    Place your PDFs in /inputs.

    Run the Gauntlet:
    Bash

    python main.py

🧬 Generator Tool (Optional)

If you don't want to write personas by hand, use the `generate_persona.py` script. It scrapes a researcher's website and uses Google Gemini to "clone" their writing style and expertise into a `.md` persona file in `personas/`.

1.  **Get a Google API Key** (Free tier available): [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2.  **Add to `.env`**:
    ```bash
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
    ```
3.  **Install requirements**:
    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai beautifulsoup4 requests
    ```
4.  **Run the generator**:
    ```bash
    python generate_persona.py
    ```
    *Input:* "Geoffrey Hinton"
    *Input:* "Deep Learning"
    *Input:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto
    
    *Result:* `personas/geoffrey_hinton.txt` is created automatically.

🎛️ Tuning the Synthesizer
The `personas/synthesizer.md` file acts as the "triage" of this brainstorming. **You should edit this prompt** to match the specific funding opportunity you are targeting. You must also instruct the synthesizer on your specific goals: do you want it to find a cohesive narrative (the "Golden Thread"), conduct a brutal risk assessment, or focus on commercial viability? Tailoring this prompt ensures the final **Action Plan** is optimized for your specific success criteria.
