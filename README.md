Gauntlet 🥊

A combinatorial multi-agent stress test for high-stakes research proposals.

Gauntlet is a "virtual brainstorming engine" designed to subject research proposals (specifically one's that are a bit cross-cutting across areas) to intense scrutiny from simulated domain experts. It uses the Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 API to create a divergence-convergence feedback loop.

Instead of a single review, Gauntlet explodes the solution space:

    Divergence: Three distinct expert personas each critique the proposal three times at different temperatures (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), naturally producing conservative, balanced, and divergent takes (Total: 9 distinct critiques).

    Convergence (The Flywheel): A "Synthesizer" agent takes every combination of one critique per expert (3³ = 27) and generates a unique strategic synthesis report for each, helping you find the "Golden Thread" narrative that satisfies all constraints.

🧠 The Expert Panel (Simulated)

    Dr. Silas Vane: Expert in Chaos Control & Swarm Dynamics.

        Role: Focuses on emergent behavior, robustness, and mathematical proofs of stability in unpredictable environments.

    Prof. Amara Kito: Expert in Bio-Photonic Interfaces.

        Role: Focuses on the physical layer, energy constraints, biocompatibility, and the "wetware" interface constraints.

    Dr. Julian Rex: Expert in Exascale Cognitive Systems.

        Role: Focuses on massive scalability, foundation model architectures, and distributed system latency.

🚀 The Logic Flow

    Ingestion: The engine reads the proposal_call.pdf and my_proposal.pdf.

    The Gauntlet (Phase 1 — Divergence): Each expert reviews the proposal three times, once at each temperature (0.3, 0.7, 1.0). Low temperature yields precise, conservative critiques; high temperature yields creative, divergent pivots. This produces 9 distinct critique vectors with no manual prompt engineering.

    The Flywheel (Phase 2 — Convergence): The system computes the Cartesian product — one run per expert — giving 3³ = 27 unique input combinations. The Synthesizer agent produces a cohesive Action Plan for each. Every output folder is self-contained: SYNTHESIS.md plus copies of the three source reviews that fed it.

    Idempotent Resume: If you hit a rate limit mid-run, just re-run main.py. It skips any output that already exists and picks up exactly where it left off.

💡 The Idea Generator (Optional Front-End)

Before running the Gauntlet you can use `idea_generator.py` to produce the proposal kernel itself. It takes a baseline paper and a rough seed idea, then drafts a proposal that has already been written *against* the same expert personas — anticipating their critiques before they happen. The output is both a Markdown file and an auto-generated PDF. You edit the markdown if needed, then feed the PDF into the Gauntlet as your proposal. See [IDEAGEN.md](IDEAGEN.md) for the full concept and how-to.

🛠 Usage

    Install dependencies:
    Bash

    pip install anthropic pypdf python-dotenv markdown-pdf

    Note: `markdown-pdf` is only needed for the Idea Generator's automatic PDF conversion.

    Add your API keys to .env:
    Plaintext

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=...           # Only needed for idea_generator.py

    Edit config.toml to select which personas and synthesizer to use.

    Run the Gauntlet, passing your two PDFs as arguments:
    Bash

    python main.py inputs/proposal_call.pdf inputs/my_proposal.pdf

    Use -o to write output to a custom directory:
    Bash

    python main.py -o runs/nsf_2026 inputs/proposal_call.pdf inputs/my_proposal.pdf

    The source code by default has TEMPERATURES: list[float] = [0.3]. Just comment that out and uncomment the previous line to get the full-blown 3 critiques per expert.




🧬 Generator Tool (Optional)

If you don't want to write personas by hand, use the `generate_persona.py` script. It scrapes a researcher's website and uses Google Gemini to "clone" their writing style and expertise into a `.md` persona file in `personas/`.

1.  **Get a Google API Key** (Free tier available): [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2.  **Add to `.env`**:
    ```bash
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
    ```
3.  **Install requirements**:
    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai beautifulsoup4 requests
    ```
4.  **Run the generator**:
    ```bash
    python generate_persona.py
    ```
    *Input:* "Geoffrey Hinton"
    *Input:* "Deep Learning"
    *Input:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto
    
    *Result:* `personas/geoffrey_hinton.txt` is created automatically.

🎛️ Tuning the Synthesizer
The `personas/synthesizer.md` file acts as the "triage" of this brainstorming. **You should edit this prompt** to match the specific funding opportunity you are targeting. You must also instruct the synthesizer on your specific goals: do you want it to find a cohesive narrative (the "Golden Thread"), conduct a brutal risk assessment, or focus on commercial viability? Tailoring this prompt ensures the final **Action Plan** is optimized for your specific success criteria.

📖 Paper Reading Mode

Gauntlet can also be used to deeply analyze research papers. Instead of a proposal review, configure it with paper-reading personas and use a simple placeholder PDF (e.g., `inputs/readpaper.pdf`) as the "call" argument, with the research paper as the "proposal":

```bash
python main.py inputs/readpaper.pdf inputs/paper_to_analyze.pdf -c config_readpaper.toml
```

The expert reviewers will deconstruct the paper from different technical angles, and the synthesizer can produce teaching-focused summaries. Use specialized configs (e.g., `config_readpaper_archgeneric.toml`) with personas tuned for paper analysis rather than proposal critique.
